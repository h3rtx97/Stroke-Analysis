The Stroke Data Analysis system has implemented how to analyse patients’ data from relevant datasets and point out potential risk conditions for stroke. Using a modular Python application, the system is developed by
combining Python features and functions with several modules for a range of statistical analyses and user-defined queries. However, Jupyter Notebook is used as a platform for the system’s simple text-based user 
interface with appropriate functionality. Although functionality like condition-based filtering and statistical analyses are completed without using in-built functions like Pandas, Numpy for data manipulation.
As far as future developments are concerned, it is recommended that such external libraries for more effective data management and graphical user interface (GUI). The system provides a strong foundation for future 
enhancements with its intended outcomes.
